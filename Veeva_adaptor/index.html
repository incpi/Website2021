            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <p>The Veeva Custom SAP CPI Adaptor enables faster and more reliable integration between Veeva CRM and SAP
                ERP, reducing the need for manual authentication and ensuring data accuracy and consistency across the
                systems.</p>
            <p>The adaptor supports various business scenarios that are common in the life sciences industry, such as
                managing orders, inventory, pricing, billing, and customer master data. This helps to streamline the
                business processes and improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>
            <p>The adaptor leverages the SAP Cloud Platform Integration service, which is a cloud-based solution that
                offers high scalability, security, and performance. The adaptor also provides a user-friendly interface
                for configuring and monitoring the integration processes, allowing for easy troubleshooting and
                maintenance.</p>

        <section id="installation">
            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>To install the Veeva Custom SAP CPI Adaptor, you need to have access to the SAP Cloud Platform
                Integration tenant and the Veeva CRM system. You also need to download the adaptor package (.esa file in
                github) and import it into your CPI tenant.</p>
            <p>After importing the adaptor package, you need to configure the connection parameters for Veeva CRM and
                SAP ERP, such as the endpoint URLs, authentication credentials, and message mapping rules. You can use
                the provided configuration guide for more details on how to set up the adaptor.</p>
            <p>Once the configuration is done, you can activate the integration flows for the business scenarios that
                you want to enable. You can also use the monitoring dashboard to view the status and logs of the
                integration processes.</p>

        <section id="limitations">
            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>As of version 1.0.0, the Veeva Custom SAP CPI Adaptor can only fetch data (via POST request to
                authenticate) from Veeva. Attempting updates on Veeva (at your own risk) might not reflect the desired
                operation.</p>

        <section id="features">
            <h2>Features & Development</h2>
            <p><strong>V1.0.0</strong></p>
            <p>Veeva authenticate (Basic Auth Supported as of now with SAP CPI security material to store it securely)
                and process execute next call for query (VQL).</p>

                Veeva responses for your reference. In case you want to know how it works...</p>
